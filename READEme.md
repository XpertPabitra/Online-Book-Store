# üìö Online Book Store (SQL Project)

This project is a **Database Management System** designed for an Online Book Store, developed using **PostgreSQL** with optional support for **MySQL**. The aim of this project is to handle all aspects of book management, customer details, and transaction records in a structured and efficient way. It covers the entire lifecycle of database operations including creating tables, inserting, updating, deleting records, and retrieving meaningful insights through optimized queries. All the SQL practice questions provided, from basic data retrievals to advanced analytics, have been solved and tested using this database. These include retrieving books by genre, finding books published after a specific year, listing customers by location, analyzing orders, calculating total stock, identifying the most expensive and least stocked books, determining top customers, and calculating total revenue. Advanced problems solved include calculating total books sold per genre, average price per genre, customers with multiple orders, most frequently ordered books, top expensive books by genre, quantity sold by each author, cities of high-spending customers, and remaining stock after fulfilling orders.

The system has been built with proper **normalized schema design**, ensuring data integrity, consistency, and eliminating redundancy. It supports adding, updating, deleting, and searching book records, maintaining a clean customer database, handling issued and returned books, and generating detailed reports with optimized SQL queries. Sample datasets are imported from **CSV files** (`books.csv` and `customers.csv`) for easy testing and demonstration. The project demonstrates real-world database design principles and practices, making it a strong foundation for anyone exploring **SQL, database design, and backend data handling**.
